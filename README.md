# GIS Portfolio
Hello! My name's Gabe (they/them) and I'm a graduate student in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm studying data visualization and Geographic Information Systems. This is my portfolio!

# About Me
My background spans from public transit to warehouse operations, from federal-level housing policy to grantwriting for small nonprofits. I'm in graduate school to build up my quantitative skills which you'll be seeing some of here!

# What I hope to learn:
I hope to develop a robust understanding of network analysis to accompany my coursework in systems analysis.
Further, I hope to just generally become fluent in the analytical tools housed in GIS softwares.

# Contact Information
You'll find my LinkedIn linked at the top of this page, as well as links to my Data Visualization portfolio.
